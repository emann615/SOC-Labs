## Define Threat Indicator

On the Log Management page, I searched the source IP address 172.16.17.45. Multiple entries were returned, but none of them correspond to the time of the alert.

## Check if the malware is quarantined/cleaned

Looking at the status next to Device Action on the alert, I can see that the malware was cleaned.

## Analyze Malware

I searched the MD5 hash for the 1word.doc file in VirusTotal. The results show that 45/61 vendors flagged the file as malicious, and it is identified as a trojan.

</br>
</br>

Next, I searched the MD5 has in Hybrid Analysis. The file was identified as malicious with a Threat Score 100/100.

</br>
</br>

I also downloaded the file to a sandbox environment and analyzed it with Any Run. Malicious activity was identified. The file creates two processes, WINWORD.EXE and powershell.exe.

</br>
</br>

The powershell.exe process was identified as a malicious, and it creates connections to multiple IP addresses.

## Check If Someone Requested the C2

On the Log Managment page, I could find no evidence that connection was made to any of the possible C2 addresses. I also checked the process history for the RichardPRD machine on the Endpoint Security page. There is no evidence of the powershell.exe process on the machine.

</br>
</br>

These findings combined with the fact that the malware was cleaned, indicates that there was no request made to the C2 address.
